                    <p itemprop="articleSection">You browse the web nearly every single day, probably using the same web
                        browser you've been using for years. They're all the same anyway, right? Modern web browsers are
                        designed to deliver a reliable and consistent user experience, regardless of which one you
                        choose or what device you use it from. But there's something different about the new kid in
                        town, and you <span style="color: #333; font-style: italic;">need</span> to learn why.</p>
                    <p itemprop="articleBody"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">It's familiar.</span> &nbsp;
                        The new Brave browser is built on the open-source Chromium codebase just like Google Chrome.
                        According to <a href="shorturl.at/koLQZ" target="_blank">netmarketshare.com</a> Chrome currently
                        has a stranglehold on the browser market, accounting for 69.19% of all web browsing, so there's
                        a good chance you're already familiar with it. At first glance, Brave looks like any other
                        Chrome clone. The interface and menus are nearly the same, and you can even use the same URL
                        shortcuts used by Chrome to access various information and browser settings, such as
                        chrome://version and chrome://settings. Brave also supports the full range of Chrome extensions
                        and can migrate bookmarks and settings from ANY browser installed on your system. On the small
                        chance that you're NOT a Chrome user, you'll still feel almost instantly at home in Brave.
                        However, Brave is anything but a copycat.<br><br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">It's FAST</span> &nbsp; The team behind Brave
                        provides plenty of info on their site to support this claim. But benchmarking environments are
                        not always a very accurate representation of everyday browser usage. Fortunately, Brave performs
                        even better in the real world than it does on paper. The user experience is polished and smooth,
                        without any of the quirks we've come to expect from "new" software. Brave renders even the
                        heaviest of pages at breakneck speed (3.8 seconds to load Hulu.com versus Chrome's 10.7, for
                        example). And if you're one of the many people who usually have about 75 more tabs open than you
                        need, you know it can lead to sluggish browsing performance. Most web browsers keep all of your
                        open tabs fully loaded in memory. But Brave attaches the currently focused tab to its main
                        worker thread on the CPU and unloads most of the resources assigned to background tabs. The
                        result is a consistently smooth experience even with dozens of tabs open. And Brave is smart
                        enough to recognize when you're playing music or other media from a backgrounded tab and won't
                        interrupt your listening.<br><br>

                        <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #000;">It's private.</span> &nbsp; Brave provides a
                        built-in ad-blocker and privacy minder known as Brave Shields. There's a little shield icon on
                        the address bar to toggle Shields. (It's on by default) Brave Shields blocks intrusive ads and
                        thwarts all of the various trackers and spyware from companies like Google and Facebook who
                        totally have your best interests in mind and aren't doing anything nefarious with your personal
                        information... *ahem* Brave's ad-block and privacy protection features are the most aggressive
                        built into any modern browser, which is a good thing, but there is a caveat. Brave can overreact
                        and attempt to block things that can break the functionality of websites. If this happens, you
                        can just toggle the "Shields down" for the affected page. Before you commit to this choice,
                        Brave will show you how many trackers and ads it has already blocked on that site. If it's an
                        extreme number, you may find it preferable to leave the page rather than expose your system and
                        information to it.<br><br>
                        Chrome is known for recording just about everything you use it for and happily phones that
                        information home to Google's data centers. The Brave team claims their browser doesn't do
                        anything of this sort. I'm happy to report that after some pretty rigorous analysis, their claim
                        seems to hold up. If all of these privacy enhancements still aren't enough for you, Brave
                        features built-in one-click access to the Tor network. If you're unfamiliar with Tor, it's a
                        routing protocol designed to prevent anyone who may be monitoring your connection from knowing
                        what websites you visit. When used correctly, Tor does an excellent job of making it
                        exceptionally difficult for anyone to associate you with your web traffic. But it can be kind of
                        a pain to get set up. Brave makes routing your traffic through Tor just as easy as opening an
                        "incognito" tab in any other browser.</p>
                    <p>In an age where all browsers are starting to feel very same-same, Brave sets itself apart from
                        the first moment you start using it. Modern browsers have become bloated with "features" that
                        most users will never discover, let alone care about. Brave returns us to a simpler time,
                        trimming the fat and delivering a refreshingly snappy and stable browsing experience. The
                        additional features it delivers are easy to appreciate, even for non-technical users. Head to <a
                            href="https://brave.com" target="_blank">https://brave.com</a> to download Brave for all
                        your devices, absolutely free, and enjoy a faster, safer web.</p>
