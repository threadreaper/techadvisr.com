       Technology can enable an organization to manage its operations efficiently, but *new* technology can also be a pain in the ass. You probably use technology every day for managing things like client records, payroll information, sales, and communications. The never-ending development of new tech creates constant sales pressure for businesses to upgrade their existing solutions. But should you really be investing in the thinnest, lightest, fastest, whatever-the-buzz-word-is-this-weekiest tech for your workplace?
      </p>
      <p itemprop="articleBody">
      </p>
      <p>
       The technology you adopt should support your business goals and the needs of your customers.  To this end you need reliable, comfortable and efficient tools. You could choose to ditch traditional e-mail in favor of using Slack for all your correspondance. You could move your accounting to the blockchain. You could open your own web-hosting provider in addition to your current business commitments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any of these choices might make sense if you are software company or a fancy new edge-computing consultancy.  But you're probably not.  Your company may be a trucking business, a lawn care provider, or perhaps a local pharmacy.  Whatever the industry, most businesses focus on providing every-day solutions to every-day problems.  In that context, devoting any of your limited attention to innovating communications technology is an excellent way to fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       What counts as boring?  Don't confuse "boring" with "bad." There is technology out there that is both boring and bad. Avoid it. But there are many examples of technology that are both boring and good. Windows is boring. Quickbooks is boring. Wired networking is boring. The nice thing about boringness (so constrained) is that the capabilities of these things are well understood. But more importantly, their failure modes are well understood.
      </p>
      <h4>
       When choosing technology, you have both known unknowns and unknown unknowns.
      </h4>
      <p>
       A known unknown is something like:
       <em>
        We don't know what happens when this database server hits 100% CPU.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       An unknown unknown is something like:
       <em>
        Geez, it didn't even occur to us that our upstart cloud provider might only have servers in a region currently being affected by a hurricane!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sets are non-empty, even for tech that's existed for decades. But for newer technology the amount and scale of unknown unknowns is significantly greater.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Prioritize Utility
      </h4>
      <p>
       I unapologetically think a bias in favor of boring technology is a good thing, but it's not the only factor that needs to be considered. Technology choices don't happen in a vaccuum. They have a scope that touches every aspect of your entire operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adding technology to your company comes with a cost. But too often people are willing to discard all constraints in favor of "using the best tool for the job."
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        My
       </em>
       job in a nutshell is to map business problems onto a solution space that involves choices of technology. If the choices were truly without baggage, I could choose a unique package of locally-the-best tools for each company that I work with. But of course, the baggage exists.  We call the baggage "operations."  You have to monitor the thing, you need to know the first thing about it to support it, you have to train employees to use it and provide access to tech support, and the list goes on and on.  So, the problem with “best tool for the job” thinking is that it takes a near-sighted view of the words “best” and “job.” My
       <em>
        job
       </em>
       is to solve problems, not introduce new ones. And the
       <em>
        best
       </em>
       solution is the one that occupies the “least worst” position for as many of your problems as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is essentially always the case that the on-going costs of keeping any technology running reliably vastly exceed any inconveniences encountered while implementing it. Mature and productive consultants understand this.
      </p>
      <h4>
       Choose New Technology, Sometimes.
      </h4>
      <p>
       Taking this notion to its
       <em>
        reductio ad absurdum
       </em>
       would mean picking Windows 7 and refusing to ever upgrade. And that would be ill-advised. You do require some means to scale, upgrade or replace aging technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good first step is to realize that this is a process that should be discussed. The implementation of a new technology that impacts everyone in the organization should require company-wide visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       An exercise I recommend here is to brainstorm how you would solve your immediate problem without adding anything new. You can accomplish a surprising amount with a small number of well-selected technology choices. The answer to this question in practice is almost never “we can’t do it,” it’s usually somewhere along the lines of “we could do it, but it would be too difficult, expensive or slow." It can be helpful to write down exactly what it is about the current solution that makes solving the problem prohibitively expensive and/or impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       New technology choices might be purely additive (for example: “we don’t have a backup solution, so let's add one”). But they might also replace things you are currently utilizig. In the latter case, you should set clear expectations about migrating old functionality to the new system with a proposed timeline. The intention of this step is to keep wreckage at manageable levels and to clearly define what "finished" means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mindful selection of technologies gives businesses real freedom: the freedom to focus on more important things.
