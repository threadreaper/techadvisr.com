                        <p>The average small business proprietor should expect to spend nearly
                        seven percent of their revenue on IT. With new technological advancements in the way we do
                        business being developed every day, it’s more important than ever to even the smallest of
                        enterprises. IT infrastructure and business software can get expensive. Getting it wrong, even
                        moreso. Simply put, it pays to have a solid, scalable and realistic IT strategy in place. Here’s why.</p></div>
                        <div itemprop="articleBody">
                            <h6>An IT Strategy Supports Business Strategy</h6>
                            <p>Your business plan may do a good job at outlining a general approach to IT. If one of your business goals is to be innovative, that certainly has implications for how you'll make technology decisions.
                            An IT strategy goes one step further. It outlines the specific measures you’ll take when it comes to approaching technology. In this sense, having an IT plan for your business supports your larger goals. For example,
                            if you want your potential customers to see you as a trustworthy brand, then your IT plan might emphasize cybersecurity. Your business plan is the general view of where your business is going. 
                            A strategy designed for IT outlines how you’ll use technology to get there.</p>
                            <h6>IT Strategies Define Priorities</h6>
                            <p>Another benefit of adopting an IT strategy for your business is that it can focus your IT decisions. It can sometimes be hard to choose between IT initiatives. You may want to upgrade your network
                                to integrate WiFi 6 technology, but you also want to automate your billing processes. Without a strategy to help you prioritize, you may invest in several IT projects and leave them half-finished. 
                                With a strategy in hand, you can zero in on the priorities that matter most for your business. Other initiatives can come after.</p>
                            <h6>Strategy is a Tool to Support Change</h6>
                            <p>Some small business owners resist creating formal strategy documents. They believe it will stop them from being responsive to change. In fact, an appropriate strategy does just the opposite. It 
                                allows you to look ahead and prepare for changes. While you may not know what those changes look like right now, a strategy tells your team how to respond to them. A strategy that outlines a 
                                flexible approach allows your team to change directions. As the technology you use changes, your team can respond in ways that support your goals. Some organizations prefer a more conservative 
                                approach. They let others test out new technologies, then adopt them slowly. They give themselves plenty of time to adjust to changes, partly by having a strategy to evaluate changes and create plans.</p>
                            <h6>An IT Strategy Supports Growth</h6>
                            <p>A business without an IT plan may run into trouble with growth. Consider the case of a company offering an app to its customers. As more customers use the app, the app uses more server resources. 
                                The company needs to invest in its servers to keep the app running smoothly. A good IT strategy for this business prioritizes the addition of resources to support app growth. Without such a plan, 
                                the company may fail to meet its overall goals. They may add servers too late, adopt the wrong technology, or fail to place servers strategically to provide failover. Your IT plan should address each 
                                goal laid out by your business plan, and explain how your technology purchases and policies are going to support those goals.</p>
                            <h6>Strategy Helps You Check What’s Working</h6>
                            <p>With any capital expenditures, small business owners want to know what they’re getting in return for their investment. An IT plan will include some measures to help you track progress and success. 
                                If one of your goals is to make your procedures more efficient, then the plan should outline how to measure efficiency. A strategic plan for IT will help you measure the effectiveness of any IT initiative
                                in your organization by outlining metrics by which the success of the implementation will be measured. From there, it’s easy to quanitify the value. As an example of this, consider a plan to implement 
                                new ERP software for a business.  Metrics to measure the success of the new software should include the amount of downtime involved with software issues, the cost of time spent on the phone with tech support,
                                and the amount of time saved by the new procedures.</p>
                            <h6>Make IT Work for You</h6>
                            <p> Developing the right IT strategy can help you propel your business forward. From cost-savings to growth to improved efficiency, IT can help you do it all. You have questions about technology, and we have answers.
                                Techadvisr will help you discover the technology solutions that fit your business, support your goals, and guide you into a profitable future.</p>
